            <h4 class="descdata">Corsair is one of the most trusted names when it comes to the best RAM on the market. Its Vengeance series, especially, has something for everyone with its LED DDR4 offerings. On top of giving PC builders that extra touch of vibrant lighting, this RAM has robust heat spreaders that maximise cooling for higher overclocking and maximum performance. Corsair’s Vengeance LED DDR4 series also features CL16 latency and whopping 3,466 MHz speeds, so it’s just as fast and responsive as it is aesthetic.</h4>

If you are truly only concerned about gaming and basic productivity tasks, you can skip down to the Intel Core i5-8400 and save yourself some money. But if you are thinking of getting into game streaming, you occasionally edit video, or you just like the idea of having more threads available when you need them, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X is an incredible value.
                <br> <br>

It delivers twice the threads of the Core i7-9700K at a lower price, while sipping less power. And while that Intel chip will deliver higher frame rates at 1080p with a high-end graphics card, if you step up to 1440p or higher, the frame rate differences tend to even out, as the GPU becomes the bottleneck. Either processor will easily deliver triple-digit frame rates at 1080p when paired with a capable card. So unless you have a high-refresh gaming monitor, you may not benefit from the extra frames the 9700K can push, anyway.

                <h3>
There is also support for PCIe 4.0 (when paired with an X570 motherboard) to consider. And the AMD chip ships with a capable and attractive Wraith Spire RGB cooler, while Intel makes you bring your own to the i7 or i9 party. The value seekers among us will also appreciate this CPUs backwards compatibility with lower-priced X470 motherboards

            Both the RTX 2080 and the GTX 1080 Ti are extremely fast, but there are some differences worth noting. The RTX 2080 utilizes faster GDDR6 memory, for one thing. And while both cards offer similar performance benchmarks, the RTX 2080 offers a boost at higher resolutions, handily beating the GTX 1080 Ti in 4K gaming. While HDR isn't a huge factor for most gamers, if you are planning to game in 4K with HDR, the RTX 2080 outperforms the GTX 1080 Ti across the board. With 4K HDR monitors still astronomically expensive, however, this is likely not a huge factor.
